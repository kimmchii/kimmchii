### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Thanachot T. or you could call me Kim

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many new things and , sometimes, I found out that those thing I won't ( HOPEFULLY ) use in the future anyway LOL. 
The subjects that I'm quite comfort with would be something about backend or analyzation that is required the understanding in such topics. 

I also involved with some tasks. Here it is 
  * FHIRxP 
    * Creating an API to connect HOSXP and FHIR
  * FHIR sushi
    * Using fsh to generate custom profiles for FHIE resoures
  * Pulse Oximeter
    * Use the sensor to connect with MCU and display a result on the OLED screen
  * Wordpress Docker-Compose
    * Link a volme and container together for addons development purpose

COMFORT WITH THESE I GUESS?
